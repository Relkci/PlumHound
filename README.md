# PlumHound - BloodHoundAD Report Engine for Security Teams
Released as Proof of Concept for Blue and Purple teams to more effectively use BloodHoundAD in continual security life-cycles by utilizing the BloodHoundAD pathfinding engine to identify Active Directory security vulnerabilities resulting from business operations, procedures, policies and legacy service operations.

PlumHound operates by wrapping BloodHoundAD's powerhouse graphical Neo4J backend cypher queries into operations-consumable reports.  Analyzing the output of PlumHound can steer security teams in identifying and hardening common Active Directory configuration vulnerabilities and oversights.

## Release and call to Action
The initial PlumHound code was released on May 14th, 2020 during a Black Hills Information Security webcast, A Blue Teams Perspective on Red Team Tools.  The webcast was recorded and is available on YouTuve here[Link TBA].

The PlumHound Framework yields itself to community involvement in the creation and proliferation of "TaskLists" (work) that can be shared and used across different organizations.  TaskLists contain jobs for PlumHound to do (queries to run, reports to write).  A second PlumHound community repo has been created to allow for the open sharing of TaskLists (see [Plumhound-Tasks](https://github.com/DefensiveOrigins/PlumHound-Tasks))

## Background
A client of ours working on hardening their Active Directory infrastructure asked us about vulnerabilities that can be found by using BloodHound.  They had heard of the effectiveness of BloodHoundAD in Red-Team's hands and was told that BloodHound would identify all types of security mis-alignments and mis-configurations in their Active Directory environment.  We helped them through analysis of their BloodHound dataset and it became quickly evident that BloodHoundAD's pathfinding graphical database was not designed for the fast-passed analytical security team accustom to reading reports and action items.  

In fact, one of our cypher queries determined that 96% of their 3000 users had a path to Domain Admin with an average of just 4 steps.  However, that graphical query rendered over 10,000 paths to Domain Admin.  Finding the actual cause of the short-paths to DA wasn't as easy as just loading data into BloodHound or putting Cobalt Strike on Auto-Pilot with BloodHound Navigation.  
Hence, PlumHound was created out of a need to retrieve consumable data from BloodHoundAD's pathfinding engine.  Data that could yield itself to inferring actionable work for security teams to harden their environments.

## Sample Reports
The sample reports are from a BadBlood created AD environment that does not include user sessions and massive ACLs that would be typical of a larger environment.  That is, the reports a bit bare, but you get the idea.  Sample reports are found in the /reports folder.  Note that by default, this is the output location for PlumHound and will over-write reports in this location if specified by the tasklist file.

## PlumHound Examples
Use the default username, password, server, and execute the "Easy" task, to test connectivity.  This will output all Active Directory user objects from the Neo4J database.

```plaintext
python3 PlumHound.py --easy
```

Execute PlumHound with the Default TaskList using Default Credentials and Database.
```plaintext
python3 PlumHound.py -x tasks/default.tasks

| PASSWORD | neo4j1 |



# HTML Report Design Output and Variables
HTML output includes the ability to use HTML Headers, Footers, and CSS to modify the design of the report.  Additionaly, variables can be added to the HTML Header and Footer files that are replaced at runtime. 
```plaintext
HTML:
  Options for HTML Output (For single queries or TaskLists

  --HTMLHeader HTMLHEADER
                        HTML Header (file) of Report
  --HTMLFooter HTMLFOOTER
                        HTML Footer (file) of Report
  --HTMLCSS HTMLCSS     Specify a CSS template for HTML Output
```

| Argument/Parameter | Default  |
|-----------|----------|
| HTMLHeader  | templates/head.html |
| HTMLFooter  | templates/tail.html |
| HTMLCSS  | templates/html.css |


| Variable                | Output                                   |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| --------PH_TITLE------- | Report Tile from --Title or TaskList/Job |
| --------PH_DATE------- | Python date.today()|

This allows the HTML output to be dynamic and tailored to your specification.



# TaskList Files
The PlumHound Repo includes a sample TaskList that exports some basic BloodHoundAD Cypher queries to an HTML Report.  The included tasks\Default.tasks sample shows the basic syntax of the TaskList files.  The TaskList Files allow PlumHound to be fully scripted with batch jobs after the SharpHound dataset has been imported not BloodHoundAD on Neo4j.

* [Hausec's Cypher Query CheatSheet](https://hausec.com/2019/09/09/bloodhound-cypher-cheatsheet/)  gave us a headstart on some decent pathfinding cypher queries.  | [Git](https://github.com/hausec)
* [SadProcessor's Blue Hands on BloodHound](https://github.com/SadProcessor/WatchDog) gave us a detailed primer on BloodHoundAD's ability to lead a BlueTeam to water. | [Git](https://github.com/SadProcessor).
* Additional work by SadProcessor with [Cypher Dog 3.0](https://github.com/SadProcessor/CypherDog) shows similar POC via utilizing BloodHoundAD's Cypher Queries with a RestAPI endpoint via PowerShell.  PlumHound operates similarly however written in python and designed for stringing multiple queries into consumable reports designed to infer actionable items. 
* [BloodHoundAD](https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound): We wouldn't be talking about this at all if it weren't for the original BloodHoundAD work.  BloodHound is developed by @_wald0, @CptJesus, and @harmj0y.
